Other Information
-----------------
This bug occurs within the playAdventurerCard function on line 272 of
dominion.c. The function returns on line 298, however there should be a call to
the discardCard function immediately preceding this return statement to discard
the Adventurer card. The card's hand position will need to be added as a
parameter to the playAdventurerCard function in order to pass it along to the
discardCard function.
