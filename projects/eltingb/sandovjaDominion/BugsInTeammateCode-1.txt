Product: Dominion game
Platform: Windows 10

Description
===========
When a player plays the Smithy card, 4 cards are drawn from the deck instead of
the 3 cards dictated by the game rules.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1. Start a Dominion game
2. Acquire a Smithy card
4. Examine the cards in hand
3. Play the Smithy card
4. Examine the cards in hand to see 1 too many cards were drawn


Expected Results
----------------
Player should have 3 more cards in hand after playing Smithy.


Actual Results
--------------
Player has 4 more cards in hand after playing Smithy.


Other Information
-----------------
This bug occurs on line 304 of dominion.c, within the playSmithyCard function:

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)

The above loop iterates 4 times, whereas it should only iterate 3 times as
follows:

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)

This bug can be tested with cardtest1.c and randomtestcard1.c.
